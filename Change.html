        Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science">natural sciences</a>, and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus">calculus</a> was developed as a
        tool to investigate it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">Functions</a> arise here
        as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous
        study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">real numbers</a> and functions of a real variable
        is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis">real analysis</a>, with <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis">complex analysis</a> the
        equivalent field for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex numbers</a>. <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis">Functional
            analysis</a> focuses attention on (typically
        infinite-dimensional) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space#Mathematics">spaces</a> of functions. One of
        many applications of functional analysis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum
            mechanics</a>.
        Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied
        as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation">differential equations</a>. Many phenomena in
        nature can be described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">dynamical systems</a>; <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos
            theory</a> makes
        precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still <a
