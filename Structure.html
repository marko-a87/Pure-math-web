        Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_objects">mathematical objects</a>, such as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">sets</a> of
        numbers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">functions</a>, exhibit internal
        structure as a consequence of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)">operations</a>or <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)">relations</a> that are defined on the set.
        Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can
        be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number theory</a> studies properties of the set of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer">integers</a>
        that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such
        structured sets (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure">structures</a>) exhibit
        similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>, to state <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axioms</a> for a class of structures, and then study at once the
        whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">groups</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)">rings</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">fields</a> and other
        abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the
        domain of <a href="abstract algebra">abstract algebra</a>. By its great generality, abstract algebra can often
        be applied to seemingly
        unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge_constructions">compass and straightedge
            constructions</a> were finally solved using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory">Galois
            theory</a>, which involves field theory and group theory.
        Another
        example of an algebraic theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear algebra</a>,
        which is the general study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector spaces</a>, whose
        elements called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)">vectors</a> have both quantity and
        direction, and can be used to model (relations between)
        points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry">geometry</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra">algebra</a> have very strong interactions in modern mathematics.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">Combinatorics</a> studies ways of enumerating the
        number of objects that fit a given structure.
