        The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">natural numbers</a> N and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer">integers</a> Z ("whole numbers")
        and arithmetical operations
        on them, which are characterized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>. The
        deeper properties of integers are studied in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number
            theory</a> , from which come such popular results as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a>. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime">twin prime</a>
        conjecture and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture">Goldbach's conjecture</a> are
        two
        unsolved problems in number theory. As the number system is
        further developed, the integers are recognized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset">subset</a> of
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number">rational numbers</a> Q ("fractions").These, in turn,
        are contained within
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">real numbers</a> R which are used to represent limits of
        sequences of
        rational numbers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous</a> quantities. Real
        numbers are generalized to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex numbers</a> C.
        According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">fundamental theorem of
            algebra</a>, all polynomial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation">equations</a>
        in one unknown with complex coefficients have a solution in the complex numbers, regardless of
        degree of the polynomial. N, Z, Q, R and C
        are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion">quaternions</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion">octonions</a>. Consideration of the natural numbers
        also
        leads to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number">transfinite numbers</a>, which formalize
        the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity">"
            infinity"</a>. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number">cardinal numbers
        </a>.
        These
        include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number">aleph numbers</a>, which allow meaningful
        comparison of the size of infinitely large sets. </p>
